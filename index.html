    <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://lsi.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Quantitative and Computational Biology</a> at Princeton University, where I specialize in computational cancer genomics under the advisement of <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~braphael/" target="_blank">Professor Benjamin Raphael</a>. My research focuses on leveraging large-scale next-generation sequencing data to devise algorithms at the intersection of computational biology and machine learning. Currently, I develop machine learning methods to identify complex interactions between somatic mutations that drive cancer progression, advancing precision medicine and therapeutic interventions.</p>

    <p>In my previous work, I have addressed challenges in proteomics, antibiotic susceptibility, image-based diagnostics, and predictive modeling for drug efficacy. I apply techniques like graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, and deep learning to create impactful computational solutions. As a researcher, engineer, and entrepreneur, I aim to blend artificial intelligence expertise to solve pressing issues in computational biology.</p>
